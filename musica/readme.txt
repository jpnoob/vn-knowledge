mashiro iro symphony (haven't tried on other games)

link to tools:
http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exmaspaz.html

tools:
- use exmaspaz to unpack/pack archive files
  - can also use garbro to unpack (not pack)

known info:
- the script is already in plaintext, no conversion needed
- using space in sentences causes the entire line to disappear. use an
  alternative space character like the 2-byte sequence 81 40 (hex) instead

TODO investigate word wrapping

TODO try a tool called fuckpaz (in fuckgalengine), which is stated to support
the following games:
Soreyori no Prologue
Tsumi no Hikari Rendezvous
trinoline
trinoline genesis
Tsumi no Hikari Rendezvous - mikan blossom
Soreyori no Prologue h append disk i guess
Sono Hi no Kemono ni wa,

this engine looks harder than usual to work with, especially finding out how
to unpack files from games that aren't supported
