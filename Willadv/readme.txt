all games
- i actually only tried on anata no koto trial

link to tools:
https://github.com/morkt/GARbro
https://github.com/jpnoob/vn-packunpack/tree/main/Willadv/arc1pack
https://github.com/Inori/FuckGalEngine/tree/master/AdvHD/wsc-bin-format
http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exbelarc.html

tools:
- use garbro to unpack archive files
  - can also use exbelarc (by asmodean)
- use arc1pack (my own util) to pack .arc files
  - can also use garbro, with file format ARC/Will, filename length 12,
- use iowsc (wsc-bin-format) to convert script files to/from .wsc and .txt

tools that didn't work for me:
- wsc2txt (found in fuwanovel's script extraction thread) didn't work on
  the script files from Anata no Koto o Suki to Iwasete trial.
