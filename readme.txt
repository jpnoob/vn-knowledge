my notes about visual novel file formats, with a focus on translating from
japanese to english and have the result be playable

advhd (very workable)
artemis (looks extremely workable)
bgi (pretty workable, but can't change system images/text)
catsystem2 (very workable)
kirikiri (very workable for some games, decrypter must exist)
musica (very workable for games where depacker exists (not so many))
willadv (looks very workable)
yuka system (workable)

yu-ris (i only took a brief look, but it looks cumbersome, some tools that don't work and lots of stuff without documentation)
malie (i only took a very brief look, but it looks very tricky)
